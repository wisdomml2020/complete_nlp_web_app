# NLP Based Web App - Summarizer, Sentiment Analysis, NER, Text Completion and Question Answering

## Project Overview

In this Natural Language Processing based web app we have used hugging face transformers for advanced text summarization, Sentiment Analysis, Text Completion and Question Answering while for Named Entity Recognition (NER) we have employed spacy - transformers. This web app is a complete NLP solution with advanced transformers. Further we will be adding Keyword Extractor and much more. This app can be used for multiple textual based tasks in daily life.  

The screenshots of the app is shown below. The web app can be accessed by clicker [here](https://share.streamlit.io/sid321axn/nlp_webapp/main/app.py)
